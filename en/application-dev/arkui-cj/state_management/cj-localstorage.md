# LocalStorage: Page-Level UI State Storage

LocalStorage is a page-level UI state storage mechanism. The parameters received through the `@Entry` macro allow sharing the same LocalStorage instance within a page. LocalStorage supports state sharing among multiple pages within a UIAbility instance.

Before reading this document, developers are advised to have a basic understanding of state management frameworks. It is recommended to first read: [State Management Overview](cj-state-management-overview.md).

LocalStorage also provides API interfaces, enabling developers to manually trigger CRUD operations for Storage keys outside custom components. It is recommended to read alongside the [LocalStorage API Documentation](../../../../en/application-dev/reference/arkui-cj/cj-state-rendering-appstatemanagement.md#localstorage页面级ui状态储存).

## Overview

LocalStorage is an in-memory "database" provided by Cangjie for constructing page-level state variables.

- Applications can create multiple LocalStorage instances, which can be shared within a page or across pages and UIAbility instances.
- The root node of the component tree, i.e., the `@Component` decorated with `@Entry`, can be assigned a LocalStorage instance. All child component instances of this component will automatically gain access to this LocalStorage instance.
- A `@Component` decorated component can access at most one LocalStorage instance and AppStorage. Components not decorated with `@Entry` cannot be independently assigned a LocalStorage instance and can only receive the LocalStorage instance passed down from the parent component via `@Entry`. A single LocalStorage instance can be assigned to multiple components on the component tree.
- All properties in LocalStorage are mutable.

The application determines the lifecycle of LocalStorage objects. When the application releases the last reference to LocalStorage (e.g., by destroying the last custom component), LocalStorage will be garbage collected.

LocalStorage provides two macros based on the synchronization type with `@Component` decorated components:

- [`@LocalStorageProp`](#localstorageprop): Variables decorated with `@LocalStorageProp` establish a one-way synchronization relationship with a given property in LocalStorage.
- [`@LocalStorageLink`](#localstoragelink): Variables decorated with `@LocalStorageLink` establish a two-way synchronization relationship with a given property in LocalStorage.

## @LocalStorageProp

As mentioned earlier, to establish a connection between LocalStorage and custom components, the `@LocalStorageProp` and `@LocalStorageLink` macros are used. Variables within a component decorated with `@LocalStorageProp(key)`/`@LocalStorageLink(key)` are bound to the corresponding property in LocalStorage identified by the `key`.

When a custom component is initialized, variables decorated with `@LocalStorageProp(key)`/`@LocalStorageLink(key)` are bound to the corresponding property in LocalStorage via the given `key`, completing initialization. Local initialization is necessary because there is no guarantee that LocalStorage will have the given `key` (this depends on whether the application logic has stored the corresponding property in the LocalStorage instance before component initialization).

`@LocalStorageProp(key)` establishes one-way data synchronization with the property corresponding to `key` in LocalStorage. If the value of the property corresponding to `key` in LocalStorage changes (e.g., via the `set` interface), the change will be synchronized to `@LocalStorageProp(key)`, overwriting the local value.

### Macro Usage Rules

| @LocalStorageProp Variable Macro | Description |
|:---|:---|
| Macro Parameter | `key`: Constant string, required (the string must be quoted). |
| Allowed Variable Types | `class`, `String`, integer, floating-point, `Bool`, `enum` types, and arrays of these types.<br>Supports `Datetime`, `Map`, `Set` types. For nested types, see [Observing Changes and Behavior](#观察变化和行为表现).<br>The type must be specified and should match the corresponding property type in LocalStorage to avoid implicit type conversion, which may lead to abnormal application behavior.<br>`Any` is not supported. |
| Synchronization Type | One-way: From the corresponding property in LocalStorage to the component's state variable. Once the given property in LocalStorage changes, it will overwrite the local content. |
| Initial Value of Decorated Variable | Must be specified. If the property does not exist in the LocalStorage instance, this initial value will initialize the property and store it in LocalStorage. |

### Variable Passing/Access Rules

| Passing/Access | Description |
|:---|:---|
| Initialization and Update from Parent Node | Prohibited. `@LocalStorageProp` does not support initialization from the parent node. It can only be initialized from the property corresponding to `key` in LocalStorage. If there is no corresponding `key`, the local default value will be used for initialization. |
| Initializing Child Nodes | Supported. Can be used to initialize `@State`, `@Link`, `@Prop`, `@Provide`. |
| Access Outside Component | No. |

### Observing Changes and Behavior

#### Observing Changes

- When the decorated data type is `Bool`, `String`, integer, or floating-point, numerical changes can be observed.
- When the decorated data type is `class`, object assignment and property changes can be observed (see [Using LocalStorage from UI](#从ui内部使用localstorage)).
- When the decorated object is an `Array`, changes such as adding, deleting, or updating array elements can be observed.
- When the decorated object is a `Datetime`, overall `Datetime` assignment can be observed, and `Datetime` properties can be updated via methods like `addYears`, `addMonths`, `addWeeks`, `addMinutes`, `addSeconds`, `addNanoseconds`. See [Decorating Datetime Type Variables](#装饰datetime类型变量).
- When the decorated variable is a `Map`, overall `Map` assignment can be observed, and `Map` values can be updated via methods like `add`, `clear`, `remove`. See [Decorating Map Type Variables](#装饰map类型变量).
- When the decorated variable is a `Set`, overall `Set` assignment can be observed, and `Set` values can be updated via methods like `add`, `clear`, `remove`. See [Decorating Set Type Variables](#装饰set类型变量).

#### Framework Behavior

- Variables decorated with `@LocalStorageProp` are immutable.
- Changes to `@LocalStorageProp` decorated variables will refresh associated components in the current custom component.
- Changes to `LocalStorage(key)` values will trigger changes in all variables decorated with `@LocalStorageProp` corresponding to `key`, overwriting local changes to `@LocalStorageProp`.

## @LocalStorageLink

If we need to synchronize updates from a custom component's state variables back to LocalStorage, `@LocalStorageLink` is required.

`@LocalStorageLink(key)` establishes two-way data synchronization with the property corresponding to `key` in LocalStorage:

1. Local modifications are written back to LocalStorage.
2. Modifications in LocalStorage are synchronized to all properties bound to the corresponding `key` in LocalStorage, including one-way (`@LocalStorageProp` and variables created via `property`) and two-way (`@LocalStorageLink` and variables created via `link`) bindings.

### Macro Usage Rules

| @LocalStorageLink Variable Macro | Description |
|:---|:---|
| Macro Parameter | `key`: Constant string, required (the string must be quoted). |
| Allowed Variable Types | `class`, `String`, integer, floating-point, `Bool`, `enum` types, and arrays of these types.<br>Supports `Datetime`, `Map`, `Set` types. For nested types, see [Observing Changes and Behavior](#观察变化和行为表现).<br>The type must be specified and should match the corresponding property type in LocalStorage to avoid implicit type conversion, which may lead to abnormal application behavior.<br>`Any` is not supported. |
| Synchronization Type | Two-way: From the corresponding property in LocalStorage to the custom component, and from the custom component to the corresponding property in LocalStorage. |
| Initial Value of Decorated Variable | Must be specified. If the property does not exist in the LocalStorage instance, this initial value will initialize the property and store it in LocalStorage. |

### Variable Passing/Access Rules

| Passing/Access | Description |
|:---|:---|
| Initialization and Update from Parent Node | Prohibited. `@LocalStorageLink` does not support initialization from the parent node. It can only be initialized from the property corresponding to `key` in LocalStorage. If there is no corresponding `key`, the local default value will be used for initialization. |
| Initializing Child Nodes | Supported. Can be used to initialize `@State`, `@Link`, `@Prop`, `@Provide`. |
| Access Outside Component | No. |

### Observing Changes and Behavior

#### Observing Changes

- When the decorated data type is `Bool`, `String`, integer, or floating-point, numerical changes can be observed.
- When the decorated data type is `class`, object assignment and property changes can be observed (see [Using LocalStorage from UI](#从ui内部使用localstorage)).
- When the decorated object is an `Array`, changes such as adding, deleting, or updating array elements can be observed.
- When the decorated object is a `Datetime`, overall `Datetime` assignment can be observed, and `Datetime` properties can be updated via methods like `addYears`, `addMonths`, `addWeeks`, `addMinutes`, `addSeconds`, `addNanoseconds`. See [Decorating Datetime Type Variables](#装饰datetime类型变量).
- When the decorated variable is a `Map`, overall `Map` assignment can be observed, and `Map` values can be updated via methods like `add`, `clear`, `remove`. See [Decorating Map Type Variables](#装饰map类型变量).
- When the decorated variable is a `Set`, overall `Set` assignment can be observed, and `Set` values can be updated via methods like `add`, `clear`, `remove`. See [Decorating Set Type Variables](#装饰set类型变量).

#### Framework Behavior

1. When changes to a `@LocalStorageLink(key)` decorated variable are observed, the modifications are synchronized back to the property corresponding to `key` in LocalStorage.
2. Once the data corresponding to `key` in LocalStorage changes, all data bound to `key` (including two-way `@LocalStorageLink` and one-way `@LocalStorageProp`) will be synchronized.
3. If the data decorated with `@LocalStorageLink(key)` is itself a state variable, its changes will not only be synchronized back to LocalStorage but will also trigger re-rendering of the associated custom component.

![LocalStorageLink(key)](figures/LocalStorageLink(key).png)

## Constraints

1. The parameters for `@LocalStorageProp`/`@LocalStorageLink` must be of type `string`; otherwise, a compilation error will occur.

    ```cangjie
    let storage =  LocalStorage()
    let temp = storage.setOrCreate("PropA", 48)

    // Incorrect usage, compilation error
    @LocalStorageProp[] let localStorageProp: Int64 = 1
    @LocalStorageLink[] var localStorageLink: Int64 = 2

    // Correct usage
    @LocalStorageProp["PropA"] let localStorageProp: Int64 = 1
    @LocalStorageLink["PropA"] var localStorageLink: Int64 = 2
    ```

2. `@LocalStorageProp` and `@LocalStorageLink` do not support decorating `func` type variables. The framework will throw a runtime error.
3. After LocalStorage is created, the type of named properties cannot be changed. Subsequent calls to `Set` must use values of the same type.
4. LocalStorage is page-level storage. For examples, see [Sharing LocalStorage Instances from UIAbility to One or More Views](#将localstorage实例从uiability共享到一个或多个视图).

## Usage Scenarios

### Application Logic Using LocalStorage

```cangjie
let storage =  LocalStorage()
let temp = storage.setOrCreate("PropA", 47)             // Create a new instance and initialize with the given object
let propA = storage.get<Int64>("PropA")                 // propA == 47
let link1 = storage.link<Int64>("PropA").getOrThrow()   // link1.get() == 47
let link2 = storage.link<Int64>("PropA").getOrThrow()   // link2.get() == 47

let value1 = link1.set(48) // Two-way sync: link1.get() == link2.get() == prop1.get() == 48
let value2 = link1.set(49) // Two-way sync: link1.get() == link2.get() == prop.get() == 49
```

### Using LocalStorage from UI

In addition to application logic using LocalStorage, the two related macros `@LocalStorageProp` and `@LocalStorageLink` can be used within UI components to access state variables stored in LocalStorage instances.

This example demonstrates the following using `@LocalStorageLink`:

- Creating a LocalStorage instance `storage` using the constructor.
- Adding `storage` to the top-level `Parent` component via the `@Entry` macro.
- Establishing two-way data synchronization by binding `@LocalStorageLink` to a given property in LocalStorage.

                    this.childLinkObject = temp;
                    })
        }
    }
}
// Make LocalStorage accessible from @Component components
@Entry[storage]
@Component

    // @LocalStorageLink macro establishes two-way binding with the "PropA" property in LocalStorage
    @LocalStorageLink["PropA"] var parentLinkNumber: Int64 = 1
    // @LocalStorageLink macro establishes two-way binding with the "PropB" property in LocalStorage
    @LocalStorageLink["PropB"] var parentLinkObject: Data = Data(0)
    func build() {
        Column(){
            Button("Parent from LocalStorage ${this.parentLinkNumber}") // Since "PropA" is initialized in LocalStorage, this.parentLinkNumber is 47
                .onClick({evt => this.parentLinkNumber += 1;})
            Button("Parent from LocalStorage ${this.parentLinkObject.code}") // Since "PropB" is initialized in LocalStorage, this.parentLinkObject.code is 50
                .onClick({evt =>
                    var temp = this.parentLinkObject
                    temp.code += 1
                    this.parentLinkObject = temp;
                    })
            // Child components automatically gain access to the Parent's LocalStorage instance.
            Child()
        }

### Simple One-Way Synchronization Between @LocalStorageProp and LocalStorage

The following example demonstrates one-way synchronization between `@LocalStorageProp` decorated data and LocalStorage:

 <!-- run -->

```cangjie
package ohos_app_cangjie_entry
import kit.ArkUI.*
import ohos.arkui.state_macro_manage.*

// Create a new instance and initialize with the given object
let storage =  LocalStorage()
let temp = storage.setOrCreate("PropA", 47)
// Make LocalStorage accessible from @Component components
@Entry[storage]
@Component
class EntryView {
    // @LocalStorageProp macro establishes one-way binding with the "PropA" property in LocalStorage
    @LocalStorageProp["PropA"] let storageProp1: Int64 = 1
    func build() {
        Column(){
            Button("Parent from LocalStorage ${this.storageProp1}")
                .onClick({evt => storage.set<Int64>("PropA", storageProp1+1)
                    ;})
        }
    }
}
```

### Simple Two-Way Synchronization Between @LocalStorageLink and LocalStorage

The following example demonstrates two-way synchronization between `@LocalStorageLink` decorated data and LocalStorage:

 <!-- run -->

```cangjie
package ohos_app_cangjie_entry
import kit.ArkUI.*
import ohos.arkui.state_macro_manage.*

// Construct a LocalStorage instance
let storage =  LocalStorage()
let temp = storage.setOrCreate("PropA", 47)
// Call the link interface to construct two-way sync data for "PropA"; linkToPropA is a global variable
let linkToPropA = storage.link<Int64>("PropA").getOrThrow()

// Make LocalStorage accessible from @Component components
@Entry[storage]
@Component
class EntryView {
    // @LocalStorageLink("PropA") creates two-way sync data for "PropA" in the Parent custom component, initial value is 47 because LocalStorage was initialized with "PropA" set to 47
    @LocalStorageLink["PropA"] var storageLink: Int64 = 1
    func build() {
        Column(){
            Text("incr @LocalStorageLink variable")
            // Clicking "incr @LocalStorageLink variable" increments this.storageLink by 1, syncing back to storage; the global variable linkToPropA will also sync
                .onClick({evt => this.storageLink += 1;})
            // Using global variables like linkToPropA.get() within components is not recommended due to potential lifecycle-related errors.
            Text("@LocalStorageLink: ${this.storageLink} - linkToPropA: ${linkToPropA.get()}")
        }
    }
}
```

### Synchronizing State Variables Between Sibling Components

The following example demonstrates### Decorating DateTime Type Variables

In the following example, the `selectedDate` decorated with `@LocalStorageLink` is of type `DateTime`. Clicking the Button changes the value of `selectedDate`, and the view refreshes accordingly.

 <!-- run -->

```cangjie
package ohos_app_cangjie_entry
import kit.ArkUI.*
import ohos.arkui.state_macro_manage.*
import std.time.*

let Storage =  LocalStorage()

@Entry[Storage]
@Component
class EntryView {
    @LocalStorageLink["date"] var selectedDate: DateTime = DateTime.of(year: 2003, month: Month.of(6), dayOfMonth: 24)
    @State var count : Int64 = 0
    func build() {
        Column(){
            Button("set selectedDate to 2025-04-21")
                .margin(10)
                .onClick({evt => this.selectedDate = DateTime.of(year: 2025, month: Month.of(4), dayOfMonth: 21);})
             Button("increase the year by 1")
                .margin(10)
                .onClick({evt => this.selectedDate = this.selectedDate.addYears(1);})
            Button("increase the month by 1")
                .margin(10)
                .onClick({evt => this.selectedDate = this.selectedDate.addMonths(1);})
            Button("increase the day by 1")
                .margin(10)
                .onClick({evt => this.selectedDate = this.selectedDate.addDays(1);})
            DatePicker( start: DateTime.of(year: 1970, month: Month.of(1), dayOfMonth: 1),
                        end: DateTime.of(year: 2100, month: Month.of(1), dayOfMonth: 1),
                        selected: this.selectedDate )
        }
        .width(100.percent)
    }
}
```

### Decorating Map Type Variables

In the following example, the `message` decorated with `@LocalStorageLink` is of type `Map<Int64, string>`. Clicking the Button changes the value of `message`, and the view refreshes accordingly.

 <!-- run -->

```cangjie
package ohos_app_cangjie_entry
import kit.ArkUI.*
import ohos.arkui.state_macro_manage.*
import std.collection.Map
import std.collection.HashMap

@Entry
@Component
class EntryView {
    @LocalStorageLink["map"] var message: Map<Int64, String> = HashMap<Int64, String>([(0, "a"), (1, "b"), (3, "c")])
    func build() {
        Row() {
            Column() {
                ForEach(
                    this.message.toArray(),itemGeneratorFunc: {item: (Int64, String), _: Int64 =>
                        Text("${item[0]}").fontSize(30)
                        Text("${item[1]}").fontSize(30)
                        Divider()
                    })
                Button("init map").onClick({evt =>
                    this.message = HashMap<Int64, String>([(0, "a"), (1, "b"), (3, "c")])
                })
                Button("add new one").onClick({evt =>
                        var temp = this.message
                        temp.add(4, "d")
                        this.message = temp
                    })
                Button("clear").onClick({evt =>
                        var temp = this.message
                        temp.clear()
                        this.message = temp
                    })
                Button("replace the first one").onClick({evt =>
                        var temp =this.message
                        temp.replace(0,"aa")
                        this.message=temp
                    })
                Button("remove the first one").onClick({evt =>
                        var temp = this.message
                        temp.remove(0)
                        this.message = temp
                })
            }
                .width(100.percent)
        }
        .height(100.percent)
    }
}
```

### Decorating Set Type Variables

In the following example, the `memberSet` decorated with `@LocalStorageLink` is of type `Set<Int64>`. Clicking the Button changes the value of `memberSet`, and the view refreshes accordingly.

 <!-- run -->

```cangjie
package ohos_app_cangjie_entry
import kit.ArkUI.*
import ohos.arkui.state_macro_manage.*
import std.collection.HashSet
import std.collection.Set

@Entry
@Component
class EntryView {
    @LocalStorageLink["set"] var message: Set<Int64> = HashSet<Int64>([0, 1, 2, 3, 4])
    func build() {
        Row() {
            Column() {
                ForEach(
                    this.message.toArray(),
                    itemGeneratorFunc: {
                        item: Int64, _: Int64 => Text("${item}")
                            .fontSize(30)
                    }
                )
                Button("init set").onClick({evt =>
                        var temp = this.message
                        temp = HashSet<Int64>([0, 1, 2, 3, 4])
                        this.message = temp
                    })
                Button("add new one").onClick({evt =>
                        var temp = this.message
                        temp.add(5)
                        this.message = temp
                    })
                Button("clear").onClick({evt =>
                        var temp = this.message
                        temp.clear()
                        this.message = temp
                    })
                Button("remove the first one").onClick({evt =>
                        var temp = this.message
                        temp.remove(0)
                        this.message = temp
                    })
            }
                .width(100.percent)
        }
        .height(100.percent)
    }
}
```
